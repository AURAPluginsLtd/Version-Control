* [New] Randomizer. Yes thats right, randomizing controls can be established now by clicking ‘randomize’ button in the main user interface and by choosing which data to randomize.

For example: User drags or copies a patch from right list and drops or pastes it into the left bank. Now the right bank is actually imported from JP-8080 and the left bank is from JP-8000. Result=mixed bank which can not be opened by any other applications. This is now fixed and data will be altered to match the original format where data is copied to.

* [Update] Logging is even deeper when activated.

Version 2.1.2 / 2016-11-18

* [Improvement] Reduced plugin memory usage -> Plugin boots faster.

* [MIDI] If device was set to wrong value at first time and set to right port at the second time, initialization message was not sent & received to check for hardware device settings.
