Version 3.0.0 build 8825 / 2022-March-10

* [New] users with macOS 10.15 and beyond can now connect to "Virus TI USB Plugin I/O" with Virus TI USB. (yes, Big Sur and Monterey users as well). Audio has to be routed from Virus to sound card or console, but we are investigating...
    Addendum: USB seems to be very slow, so if you have MIDI device, use that instead!

* [Fixed] Resolved issue where MIDI data was not properly handled causing continuous Device ID checks.
* [Fixed] Resolved issue where bank edit indicator did not display when requesting data from hardware to librarian.
