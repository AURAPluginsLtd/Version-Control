* [New] Global Lock – This locks the MIDI channels per slot and other performance settings which are not single patch settings. If Global Lock is on, performances clicked through the librarian will be sent to hardware so that it picks up the user interface settings along. This ensures the MIDI channels and other settings are intact. Releasing Global Lock sends the data as is.

* [Important] This version is not backward compatible with the v1.x.x. It is very important that you make a backup of your project, open the project with old plug-in instance in use -> send data to hardware -> store the performance in hardware -> install new plug-in version and request data from Hardware to continue where you were left off.
* [Important] Plug-in license.key should be copied manually to folder mentioned above or via Librarian -> Bank Edit menu -> Register plug-in… if the display indicates “Reload License”.
