[New] Tooltips included. Tooltip text copied from microQ User Manual.

[Fixed] Requesting Data to Librarian didn't work as expected.
[Fixed] Setting Device ID before setting MIDI I/O didn't work as expected.
[Fixed] Discard changes button was not visible after librarian requests.

[Other] User Manual is not yet available. Use tooltips to show function purpose. 
    Most are self-explanatory.

    before applying this update.
