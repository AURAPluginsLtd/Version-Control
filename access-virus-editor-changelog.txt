Version 3.0.0 build 6943 / 2021-December-11

* [New] When part is changed, plugin / application display will show the 
      current value.
* [Fixed] Resolved issue where part 1 button remained active at multimode mixer 
      page when part was changed.
* [Fixed] Resolved issue where save and load UI Data and CC Maps was pointing 
      to wrong location.
* [Fixed] Resolved issue where Logic Pro did not show the plugin User Interface 
      on initialization.
* [Fixed] Resolved issue where VST3 had only one MIDI input channel instead of 
      16. 
* [Improvement] Virus OS type specifier improvements. Now OS is tied to 
      specific model selection. We expect user to have latest available OS 
      installed in their Virus to use the plugin / application the way it is 
      expected to work.
