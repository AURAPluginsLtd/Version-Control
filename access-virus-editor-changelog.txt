Version 3.0.0 build 8838 / 2022-March-25

[new] If bank contains data which has Access Virus header in it, 
    but the data is too small per Virus model standards, it will
    be ignored and initialized for safety reasons.
    This might remove some patches from the bank, but it allows
    user to open banks which are corrupted for some reason.
    Backup your banks before installing!
