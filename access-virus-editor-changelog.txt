Version 3.0.0 build 6932 / 2021-December-08

[new] Patch Librarian can now export "classic" banks to TC Electronic 
    Virus|PowerCore compatible format.
    - Patch Librarian -> Bank Edit Menu -> Save As ... -> Virus|Powercore.
[fixed] Resolved issue where User Interface was downscaled even when there was room
    to display it in full scale.
