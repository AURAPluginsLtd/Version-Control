Version 3.0.0 build 7016 / 2022-January-05

* [Fixed] Resolved issue where 0xf8 and 0xfe were passed through even when
    they were set to OFF. This should eliminate "connection error" issues all
    together.
* [Other] Improved data handling when setting MIDI input and output. Initial
    commands are now sent to output port before checking if the device is
    present.
* [Other] External MIDI Sense is set to be ignored. Might add option to filter
    midi sense and midi clock messages directly from advanced midi settings.
* [Other] Extended logging system for development purposes. Send the plugin
    log file from /Music/Mystery Islands Music/Access Virus Editor/ folder to
    development@mysteryislands-music.com with steps how to reproduce the
    issue. Thank you!

Version 3.0.0 build 7001 / 2021-December-25

Version 3.0.0 build 6967 / 2021-December-17
