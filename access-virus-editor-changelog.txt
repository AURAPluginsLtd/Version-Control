Version 3.0.0 build 6895 / 2021-November-27

* [New] Extended tooltips. Once mouse is hover over the control, a popup will appear with 
        explanation of the control function. Previously user could only see the control 
        value and name in the plugin / app display.
* [New] Completely rewrote portition of the code which handles the patch and multi 
        renaming. No more waiting of data transfers after renaming.
* [Fixed] Reverb Feedback value was not recorded properly when parsing patch data nor 
          while sending data to hardware.
* [Fixed] Resolved issue where multi fx settings were not updated accordingly when master 
          fx part patch was changed.
* [Fixed] Resolved issue where Oscillator 2 Local Detune was not working as expected.
* [Fixed] Virus TI models total recall rate adjusted. Might be slower, but this ensures 
          better data processing in hardware.
* [Other] In order for data sending to succeed, you MUST follow these steps when loading 
   new instance of Virus Editor:
