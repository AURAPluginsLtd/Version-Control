Version 3.0.0 build 6923 / 2021-December-05

[new] Native Apple Silicon support for Standalone Application and Plugins *.
[new] Apple Silicon forced us to change the data folder structure completely.
 You can find all plugin / application related files as follows;
    (Patches): "/Library/Mystery Islands Music/Presets/Access Virus Editor/Patches/".
    (CC Maps): "/Library/Mystery Islands Music/Presets/Access Virus Editor/CC Maps/".
    (UI Data): "/Library/Mystery Islands Music/Presets/Access Virus Editor/UI Data/".
    (License and LOG file): "/Library/Mystery Islands Music/Access Virus Editor/".
[new] If plugin or application fails to load license, user can initiate license
 loading dialog from the top left corner of our plugin / application.
[new] Plugin / Application window will be automatically resized if it will not fit to
 current display.
[fixed] Update checker did not work as expected.
[fixed] Standalone Application menu titles shown as they should.
[fixed] Using "Menu 2" for Application / Plugins now has scrolling option if menu
 draw area exceeds the display area.

* We are waiting for Pro Tools Native M1 support to arrive so we can include M1 AAX version.
