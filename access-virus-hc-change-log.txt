Version 1.5.14 / 2018-11-07

* [Fixed] Saving TI bank as MIDI file is now recognized in the Access Virus TI Control Software.
* [Fixed] Resolved issue where VirusHC would crash if Virus TI was booted with Virus TI USB connected to computer.


Version 1.5.13 / 2018-11-03

* [Fixed] Resolved issue where patch bank storing to HDD made the bank incompatible with Virus TI models.
* [Other] Improved patch / multi file handling system.


Version 1.5.12 / 2018-10-30

* [Fixed] Resolved issue where patch category did not update in the plug-in display accordingly after changing preset in patch librarian or via hardware.


Version 1.5.11 / 2018-10-26

* [Fixed] Resolved issue where 32-bit installers did not work as expected.
* [Other] Changed “Send all MIDI data from Plug-in:” to “Directly to Hardware” by default, since some users with large buffer settings were not able to get notes triggered at all.


Version 1.5.10 / 2018-10-16

* [Fixed] Resolved issue where TI multi parameters were not recalled properly.
* [Fixed] Resolved issue where TI effect parameters were not recalled properly. (works now after requesting data from hardware to plug-in. Old data is recalled like it used to be).
* [Fixed] Resolved issue where TI data was not decoded properly depending of the TIOS installed in Virus hardware.
* [Fixed] Resolved issue where single patches were not written to hardware memory (rephrase).


Version 1.5.9 / 2018-09-24

* [Fixed] Resolved issue where plug-in caused noise on start-up.
* [Fixed] Resolved issue where plug-in scanned files and moved “incompatible” files to “Converted Banks” folder. Users are advised to check out “Converted Banks” folder and move any files back to original folder to re-scan them.
* [Fixed] Users banks which contains less than 128 presets are visible again in the Patch Librarian.
* [Fixed] Resolved issue where non-TI or classic model patches did not update the TI effects settings accordingly.
* [Fixed] Resolved issue where users were not able to adjust parameters on first attempt.


Version 1.5.8 / 2018-09-18

* [Fixed] Resolved issue with Virus TI where delay parameters did not update the plug-in UI when changing patches.
* [Fixed] Resolved issue where delay parameters were not recalled properly when opening a project.
* [New] If part is set to Muted, it won’t be recalled to, or requested from hardware by the plug-in. This saves some time when recalling a project and when synchronizing data from hardware to plug-in UI. For example, 16 part total recall with Virus TI using 600ms request interval takes ~13 seconds to send the data to Virus, but if only parts 1-3 are enabled and 4-16 muted, it takes ~4 seconds. Time is money!


Version 1.5.7 / 2018-09-18

* [Fixed] Resolved issue where Master Delay/Reverb Part was messed up when changing value from hardware. Now if master FX part is set to 1 from plug-in, Send Level will be assigned to appropriate part, everything else will change the master FX part values. (pre-TI).

* [Fixed] Time-out issues should be resolved. In some cases, even though the cables and midi interface was ok, plug-in indicated that it was not able to make the connection.
* [Fixed] Semitone should behave as expected when knob is moved from hardware.
* [New] Randomizer – You can now freely randomize any part you wish.
* [New] Section Locks – Compine together with Randomizer and you can keep some of the best settings of the randomized or even the current preset. If section locks are toggle on, patches sent from librarian will have your parts locked in place.
* [New] Better UI – We made some small adjustment to the user interface. We know there are a lot people asking for a bigger User interface, but at this time and due the last update issues, we were not able to ship it with this release.

* [New] Librarian menu improvement – You can now toggle + or – to choose next or previous bank from the dropdown list, without having to open the menu.
* [New] Librarian Bank Edit Menu – revised to keep multi data and single data requests on their segments. Multi bank menu actions can be seen when Single Patches / Multi Bank Files button is toggled.
* [New] Limit bank view by categories – We made our own way to display all categories in the dropdown menu. Check it out!


Version 1.5.0 / 2017-11-04

* [Fixed] Windows 64bit plug-in is not actually 64bit plug-in. NOTE: not backward compatible!


Version 1.4.13 / 2017-03-28

* [Fixed] Save or Save As MIDI files are now compatible with Virus TI Control Software and sequencer applications capable of playing back MIDI files containing patches.

If user sets part 1 as a master, patches changed at part 1 will also change the delay/reverb setting to multi/all patches accordingly. All other parts will indicate that part 1 is master and only effect send knob is available for adjustment. Master part can be changed at any time in multimode mixer settings page to hear if another parts fx is more suitable.
* [New] Librarian now includes ‘Cancel’ button, to cancel current request of arrangement, single or multi patches from hardware.
* [New] Finetuned plug-in framework to set request interval in 500ms with Pre-TI models and 1000ms for TI models. This is due to message size the hardware sends / receives.
* [New] Virus TI Snow added to model list and this ensures that right amount of patch data is requested when arrangement is called and some UI elements are temporarely grayed out to prevent touching un-needed parts. These elements will be re-drawn for v2 release in future.

Version 1.4.5 / 2016-04-26

* [Important!] When data is sent to hardware, we force legacy Virus to MULTI mode in order to receive multi settings properly. This is why we HIGHLY recommend all users to use Virus in MULTI mode while working with the plugin. If MULTI SINGLE / SINGLE mode is used, none of the multimode mixer settings are received up on project recall or if ”force to device” button is pressed. So one more time: ALWAYS STICK IN THE MULTI MODE. You can change & scroll through patches in multi single mode, but must return to multi mode if you recall your project.

* [Update] SysEx data is now being sent & received with new intervals due to some reports of patch data not being collected properly to our librarian. In Virus TI, each patch request is processed after 1000ms and in legacy models the requestinterval is 800ms.
* [Core] Other minor coding tweaks and cleanups.
